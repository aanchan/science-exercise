    "### Personal note on the exercise\n",
    "My PhD thesis was on transfer learning, and I discovered how easy things have gotten since I had to write generators and mark trainable layers on my own. A large part of this exercise was for me learning to use the new and shiny Keras API which has changed a lot since I last touched it. I first started this exercise with an example of MobileNet with this blog post as a reference (https://towardsdatascience.com/keras-transfer-learning-for-beginners-6c9b8b7143e). It turns out that MobileNet (Or InceptionV3 for example) is possibly not the best place to start since there are issues with transfer learning and normalization using BatchNorm which need some additional work. Here is a StackExchange post for reference: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/47966/over-fitting-in-transfer-learning-with-small-dataset. BatchNorm it turns out learns statistics of the original data set. As a result the model really does not perform that well on the first run. This first exercise really is my quick and dirty way of exploring first in terms of what works and what does not work from a modelling aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on model selection\n",
    "Though this is not my favourite way of doing things, for the purposes of this exercise I explored three models to work with namely : \n",
    "- a vanilla convolutional network with very few parameters. I call this `model_1` in the variables below.\n",
    "- MobileNet as mentioned above. I call this `mobile_net` in the variables below.\n",
    "- VGG16 : Of interest in picking VGG16 were these two blog posts (https://riptutorial.com/keras/example/32608/transfer-learning-using-keras-and-vgg) and (https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html). I call this bool variable `vgg_net` below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Preprocessing functions\n",
    "I introduce these three variables below to pick the appropriate preprocessing functions before picking the data generators. For the vanilla convnet I settled at using a zoom_range of 0.2 and a horizonal flip since these seemed to make the largest difference on the validation error for this model. Given the time allotted to the exercise I did not dig deep into the implementation functions for MobileNet and VGGNet16.\n"

K-fold cross-validation would be the ideal way to evaluate the performance of these models on this small data set.

This it turns out the link is dead to download the database. I did not explore obtaining additional datasets for this exercise in the interest of time, and settled towards using a train-validation split on the generators from Keras. Furthermore, the data can be certainly augmented by introducing \"noisy\" versions of the training images in the data set. This again was not pursued in the interest of time.\n",

    "This step runs the vanilla convnet which has two convolutional layers with max-pooling followed by a dense layer with softmax. Given the small amount of data a simple classifier often is a good first place to start in order to be able to see what classes get confused the most and so on. The model was tweaked a little bit by looking at the performance of the model on the validation set. For example a batch size of 16 seemed to make a performance hit, vs trying kernel sizes of (3,3) vs (5,5). A kernel size of (5,5) was finally chosen for performance reasons. Dropout seemed to make a difference in the final dense layer and a value of 0.5 seemed to be better than 0.25. Furthermore, a callback function was written to save the weights locally depending on the model that gave the best validation performance over 50 epochs. In addition I initially tried two dense layers vs the one that is currently in the model. The validation performance was fairly poor since the model was overparameterized and was overfitting. I tried changing 'Adam' vs 'RMSProp' as well - Adam anecdotally seemed to perform better. One can see with this simple model and the validation accuracy numbers that one can reach perhaps an accuracy of 70-75% on this limited validation set."

    "Understanding model performance is often an important part of the workflow. While validation scores and training and validation error curves are great to look at to see if training is progressing correctly, it is often informative to look at a confusion matrix and metrics other than accuracy in especially detection problems and look at things like precision, recall and f1-score. For this exercise I often found through the use of the confusion matrix that my model was actually never really learning anything. For a bad training run where my model really wasn't really learning anything I found examples from all classes being classified as a single class. From the confusion matrix below on the validation set one can see that the model is at least learning \"something\", but more so see where the model is lacking. "

    "One of the things (among many) that I learned while playing around with these pre-trained models was that the input image tensor size was fixed to a particular size. For example MobileNet has its (image_width, image_height) set to (224,224). This can often be an issue with low-resolution images such as the one provided for this exercise. As a result the input tensor often needs to be changed. There are multiple blog posts which talk about this issue, such as https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/06/24/change-input-shape-dimensions-for-fine-tuning-with-keras/.  What appears below is a `change_model` function that was taken from [this](https://medium.com/@ckyrkou/changing-input-size-of-pre-trained-models-in-keras-3dfbe3ca3091) blog-post. As mentioned earlier, this model does not give the best validation set performance. One reason could be models of this class that use BatchNorm could be remebering statistics of the original dataset instead. Furthermore, checking the accuracy of the input tensor, and the weights that are finally loaded and convolved need to be checked."
